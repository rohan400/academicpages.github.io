I am Rohan Kumar Yadav, a PhD Research Fellow at Centre for Artificial Intelligence Research Lab, University of Agder, Norway. I am working on the project of Chatbot for Education using Tsetlin Machine and Deep Learning.  More specifically, I am interested in Interpretable model in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Hence, I am focused on a new Machine Learning model called Tsetlin Machine. Currently, my works are related to word sense disambiguation, sentiment analysis, context dependent language understanding etc. Simultaneously, I am also working on some recent trends of NLP like self-attentions and transformers.

Before joining my PhD, I completed my MSc in Information and Communication from Chosun University, South Korea. I worked as Graduate Research Assistant at Wireless Mobile Communication System Lab on Indoor Positioning Techniques using Machine Learning. Moreover, I have completed my Bachelorâ€™s degree from Sona College of Technology/Anna University in 2015.
